## Introduction

For this project we are trying to build an average IMDb rating 
prediction model for a given movie. The model can be used to provide
an insights for movie makers and movie marketing decision maker to
estimate the public sentiment towards for a given new movie prior to
release. 

The [IMDb ratings](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/ratings-faq/G67Y87TFYYP6TWAV#) 
is the weighted average rating given by a IMDb registered user who 
can cast a vote (from 1 to 10) on every released title in the IMDb 
database. IMDb database includes all released movies, TV shows which 
are minimally have been shown in public for at least one time. Users 
can update and overwrite their existing vote as many times as they want.

The data set used in this project will be using the information given
by the IMDb database released by IMDb.com. Detail 

plus additional information regarding to the titles
from other sources such as Wikipedia will be collected to enrich the 
dataset. (If time permits)
